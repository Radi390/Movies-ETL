# Movies-ETL

## Overview
In this project, the purpose is to create an ETL pipeline to extract, Transform and Load from various sources and integrate them to a single well-formatted dataset and Load it on a table in PostgreSQL.

Tow sources have been used in this project, one from [Wikipedia movies](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-online/module_8/wikipedia-movies.json) with JSON format. And one from Kaggle. The [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download) pulls from the MovieLens dataset of over 20 million reviews and contains a metadata file with details about the movies from The Movie Database (TMDb).
